# JPaint Project - SE450
This is a project for DePaul University's SE450 Object-Oriented Software Development Class. The application mimics Microsoft Paint and is made entirely in Java. The main objectives of this project were to follow the SOLID principles and implement at least 5 unique design patterns while creating the different paint functionalities over a 10-week period. My application implements six design patterns; command, builder, factory method, strategy, decorator, and composite. A full project report including UML diagram documentation is included as a PDF file titled "JPaint Final Report - Bryan Morandi".
